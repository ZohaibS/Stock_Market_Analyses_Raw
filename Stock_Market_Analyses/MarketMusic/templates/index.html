                        <p>Stock market analysis has been in-focus due to fluctuations that cause ripple effects on the economy, 
                            both positive and negative. Since analysis tools have been more in the fore-front, various methods have been applied
                            trying to predict stock prices towards understanding future market fluctuations and stability. For these analyses, data consisting of the
                            Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE: DIA) and deep larning via Recursive Neural Networks (RNN) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA) were applied.
                            Additionaly, another approach was undertaken using Direct Signal Processing (DSP) as a means of comparison to machine learning techniques. At the
                            outset to help understand and visualize market prediction, the following questions were investigated:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Is there a correlation between daily volume and volatility in the stock market?</b></li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Can we use the daily closing price of a stock to forecast with confidence the future price of the stock?</b></li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>What kind of approaches can we use to better filter market noise in our regression models?</b></li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Can we derive unique insights and a different approach to measuring volatility from studying the shape of signals?</b></li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>

                        <p>ETFs are marketable securities that track a stock index, a commodity or bond, or a basket of assets. Although similar
                            in many ways, ETFs differ from mutual funds because shares trade like common stock on an exchange. The price of an 
                            ETF’s shares will change throughout the day as they are bought and sold. The largest ETFs typically have higher 
                            average daily volume and lower fees than mutual fund shares which makes them an attractive
                            alternative for individual investors.</p>

                                    <li>The daily value of a stock represents the liquidity of the stock. The higher the volume traded, the more liquid the stock can be considered and the lower the day to day volatility with the said stock. </li>
                                    <li>We can use the moving average of daily stock prices to attempt to predict future prices.</li>
                                    <li>The Fourier transform is one of the most powerful tools that we can use to build a variety of machine learning algorithms intended to forecast the stock market.</li>
                                    <li>Applying Topological Data Analysis to the point cloud derived from a return signal can help us understand the underlying "music" a stock plays.</li>
