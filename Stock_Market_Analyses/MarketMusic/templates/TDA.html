                        <h3 class="article-meta">TDA and Fourier Analysis Combined</h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis" target="_blank">TDA - Wikipedia</a>
                  
                        <p>In applied mathematics, topological data analysis (TDA) is an approach to the analysis of datasets using
                           techniques from topology. Extraction of information from datasets that are high-dimensional, 
                           incomplete and noisy is generally challenging. TDA provides a general framework to analyze such data
                           in a manner that is insensitive to the particular metric chosen and provides dimensionality reduction and
                           robustness to noise. Beyond this, it inherits functoriality, a fundamental concept of modern mathematics, 
                           from its topological nature, which allows it to adapt to new mathematical tools.</p>

                        <p>This analysis delves into studying the shape of data, where TDA has combined algebraic topology and other tools
                           from pure mathematics such as signals processing to allow mathematically rigorous study of "shape". The main tool is persistent homology,
                           an adaptation of homology to point cloud data. This analysis involves using the same process from the DSP page
                           to obtain a filtered point cloud, partitioned based on timeframes the signals appeared within. An example of the work flow is as follows:</p>

                           <center><img src="{{url_for('static', filename='Figures/TDA/Illustration_of_Typical_Workflow_in_TDA.jpeg')}}"></center>


                        <p>Using pointclouds from various timeframes, topological data analysis is used 
                           to study the shape of the various "notes" the stock plays. The two main metrics
                           investigated in our TDA analysis involved bottleneck distances between timeframes and "loops"
                           within the timeframes.</p>

                        <p>To understand how 'noisy' the dataset is, a 'bottleneck' distance (represented on the y-axis) informs ATLEAST how much noise 
                           is added from one analysis-window to the next. It provides a rough idea of how much more stochastic one window is from the next.
                           Below is the relevant visual.</p>

                        <p>In essence, constantly growing circles are wrapped around datapoints which the alogrithm can then proceed 
                           to connecting dots and creating shapes. As the circles around points grow, interesting things begin to happen
                           with created shapes and time loops, as well as times loops being destroyed. Below is a persistence diagram labeling the birth times and death times of these loops throughout
                           the analysis timeframes.</p>

                        <p>Finally, the total number of loops that were born and killed during the analysis. Notice
                           the massive spike in the number of loops during the timeframe containing the 2008 market crash.</p>

                        <p>At the risk of oversimplifying TDA, its at its very basics an algorithm 
                           specifically catered to analyzing shapes within point clouds. On a small scale, this may be insignificant.
                           On a larger scale, the analysis could run using month long intervals over a decade or more incurring hundreds
                           of timeframes with different shapes. Running additional machine learning algorithms on this layer can help 
                           determine classifiers related to distinct shapes the algorithm sees and can give unique insights into
                           preceding timeframes of significant interest.</p>

                        <p>Note that this combination of Topological Data Analysis and Fourier Analysis is still in its infancy.
                           Looking for other literature on this topic led to no useful leads. Hence, this approach is just a starting
                           point for future machine learning ensembles.</p>
