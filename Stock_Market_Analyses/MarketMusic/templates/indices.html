            <h1><left>Stock Market Analysis Overview</left></h1>
               <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <p>Stock market analysis has been in-focus due to fluctuations that cause ripple effects on the economy, 
                      both positive and negative. Since analysis tools have been more in the fore-front, various investigations have been completed
                      to understand future market fluctuations via stock prices and stability. For this analysis, data consisting of the
                      Dow Jones Inductrial Index and deep larning via Recursive Neural Networks (RNN) and Topological Data Analysis (TDA) were applied.
                      Additionaly, another approach was applied using Direct Signal Processing (DSP) as a means of comparison to machine learning techniques. At the
                      outset to help understand and visualize market prediction, the following questions are to be investigated:</p>
                     <br>
                  <li><b>What might be the short-term stock future?</b></li>
                     <br>
                  <li><b>How many days per time-period did the DJIA take a large hit (2% change)?</b></li>
                  <br>
                  <br>

            <p>ETFs are marketable securities that track a stock index, a commodity or bond, or a basket of assets. Although similar
               in many ways, ETFs differ from mutual funds because shares trade like common stock on an exchange. The price of an 
               ETFâ€™s shares will change throughout the day as they are bought and sold. The largest ETFs typically have higher 
               average daily volume and lower fees than mutual fund shares which makes them an attractive
               alternative for individual investors.</p>
